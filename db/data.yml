    - It Ends With Her Kindle Edition
    - "He started the game. She’ll end it.\r\n\r\nFBI special agent Clarke Sinclair
      doesn’t give up easily. She’s spent years tracking serial killer Simon Cross,
      forced to follow his twisted clues and photographs across the country. Clarke
      knows that Cross selects only redheaded women and that he doesn’t target another
      victim until Clarke discovers the previous one.\r\n\r\nHe’s never broken pattern…until
      now.\r\n\r\nA girl has already gone missing in upstate New York when a second
      one is kidnapped—a blonde. The killer’s MO has changed, sending Clarke back
      to the drawing board. The closer she gets to the truth, the deeper she’s drawn
      into an inescapable trap made just for Clarke. Whatever Cross’s ultimate game
      is, it ends with her."

    - A Brief History of Time Paperback – Unabridged, September 1, 1998
    - "A landmark volume in science writing by one of the great minds of our time,
      Stephen Hawking’s book explores such profound questions as: How did the universe
      begin—and what made its start possible? Does time always flow forward? Is the
      universe unending—or are there boundaries? Are there other dimensions in space?
      What will happen when it all ends?\r\n\r\nTold in language we all can understand,
      A Brief History of Time plunges into the exotic realms of black holes and quarks,
      of antimatter and “arrows of time,” of the big bang and a bigger God—where the
      possibilities are wondrous and unexpected. With exciting images and profound
      imagination, Stephen Hawking brings us closer to the ultimate secrets at the
      very heart of creation."

    - The Rails 5 Way (4th Edition) (Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series) 4th
      Edition
    - "Praise for The Rails Way\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"For intermediates and above, I strongly
      recommend adding this title to your technical bookshelf. There is simply no
      other Rails title on the market at this time that offers the technical depth
      of the framework than The Rails™ 3 Way.\"\r\n\r\n—Mike Riley, Dr. Dobb’s Journal\r\n\r\n
      \r\n\r\n\"I highly suggest you get this book. Software moves fast, especially
      the Rails API, but I feel this book has many core API and development concepts
      that will be useful for a while to come.\"\r\n\r\n—Matt Polito, software engineer
      and member of Chicago Ruby User Group\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"This book should live
      on your desktop if you’re a Rails developer. It’s nearly perfect in my opinion.\"\r\n\r\n—Luca
      Pette, developer\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"The Rails™ 3 Way is likely to take you from
      being a haphazard poke-a-stick-at-it programmer to a deliberate, skillful, productive,
      and confident RoR developer.\"\r\n\r\n—Katrina Owen, JavaRanch\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I
      can positively say that it’s the single best Rails book ever published to date.
      By a long shot.\"\r\n\r\n—Antonio Cangiano, software engineer and technical
      evangelist at IBM\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"This book is a great crash course in Ruby
      on Rails! It doesn’t just document the features of Rails, it filters everything
      through the lens of an experienced Rails developer—so you come out a pro on
      the other side.\"\r\n\r\n—Dirk Elmendorf, cofounder of Rackspace Inc. and Rails
      developer\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"The key to The Rails Way is in the title. It literally
      covers the 'way' to do almost everything with Rails. Writing a truly exhaustive
      reference to the most popular web application framework used by thousands of
      developers is no mean feat. A thankful community of developers that has struggled
      to rely on scant documentation will embrace The Rails Way with open arms. A
      tour de force!\"\r\n\r\n—Peter Cooper, editor, Ruby Inside: The Ruby Blog\r\n\r\n
      \r\n\r\n\"In the past year, dozens of Rails books have been rushed to publication.
      A handful are good. Most regurgitate rudimentary information easily found on
      the Web. Only this book provides both the broad and deep technicalities of Rails.
      Nascent and expert developers, I recommend you follow The Rails Way.\"\r\n\r\n—Martin
      Streicher, chief technology officer, McClatchy Interactive, former editor in
      chief of Linux Magazine\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Hal Fulton’s The Ruby Way has always
      been by my side as a reference while programming Ruby. Many times I had wished
      there was a book that had the same depth and attention to detail, only focused
      on the Rails framework. That book is now here and hasn’t left my desk for the
      past month.\"\r\n\r\n—Nate Klaiber, Ruby programmer\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I knew
      soon after becoming involved with Rails that I had found something great. Now,
      with Obie’s book, I have been able to step into Ruby on Rails development coming
      from .NET and be productive right away. The applications I have created I believe
      to be a much better quality due to the techniques I learned using Obie’s knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n—Robert
      Bazinet, InfoQ.com, .NET, and Ruby community editor and founding member of the
      Hartford Ruby Brigade\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Extremely well written; it’s a resource
      that every Rails programmer should have. Yes, it’s that good.\"\r\n\r\n—Reuven
      Lerner, Linux Journal columnist"

    - 'Ruby on Rails 5: Web App Development for Beginners'
    - 'his book is an exploration of Ruby on Rails 5. It begins by guiding you on
      how to setup the Rails development environment on your local computer in various
      platforms. You are then guided on how to test the various parts of your Rails
      5 app. Test-Driven Development is also explored in detail. The MVC (Model-View-Controller)
      architecture for apps is discussed. You will learn how to implement a Rails
      5 app using such architecture for ease of development, maintenance, and organization.
      Each of the modern web apps is in need of an authentication system. This helps
      us to regulate how the resources of your app are accessed. This book guides
      you on how to create an authentication system with Rails. It is also good for
      us to implement a mechanism for activating accounts via email. This also allows
      us to know whether a user has provided a valid email address or not. This book
      guides you on how to implement such a system in Rails 5. You will learn how
      to deploy a Rails 5 app with Heroku. The following topics are explored in this
      book: - Install and Setup your Rails Development Environment - Testing and Test-Driven
      Development - Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern - Static Pages - Implementing
      an Authentication System - Account Activation and Password Reset - Application
      Deployment'

    - 'Rails: Novice to Ninja: Build Your Own Ruby on Rails Website 3rd Edition'
    - "Rails: Novice to Ninja is an easy-to-follow, practical and fun guide to Ruby
      on Rails for beginners. It covers all you need to get up and running, from installing
      Ruby, Rails and SQLite to building and deploying a fully-featured web application.
      The third edition of this book has been fully updated to cover Rails 5, the
      latest version of the framework.\r\n\r\nUnlike other Rails books, this book
      doesn't assume that you are an experienced web developer, or that you've used
      Ruby before. An entire chapter is devoted to learning Ruby in a fun way, using
      the interactive Ruby console, so you can follow along at home. You'll be an
      accomplished Ruby programmer in no time! You'll then start using Rails to build
      a practical, working project: a Reddit-like social news application. As you'll
      build the app, you'll gain valuable experience of using Rails features such
      as user authentication, session cookies, and automated testing. The book finishes
      with chapters on debugging, benchmarking and deployment to a live web server."
